This is a standard console appliation which will prompt user for name and then cycle through a series of security questions.
If the user has not used the system before then the user will be required to answer three questions to continue.
If the user has used the system before then the user will be promoted to answer 1 of the 3 stored security questions correctly to continue.
My design was symple, encapsulate and utilize simple patterns such as the iterator pattern for reading and writing to the file.
